# Medical Role-Play Game
BSMS Virtual Work Experience Reflective Tasks by EnTong Qian (Dora)

# Overview

This project is a reflection on the BSMS Virtual Working Experience, the course that provids me with an in-depth understanding of the NHS system, major types of health services, and an initial guide to become a doctor. By integrating the knowledge and skills acquired from the BSMS program, I developed this Python simulation that replicates real-life scenarios encountered by two types of healthcare professionals: Emergency Doctors and General Practitioners.

This simulation demonstrates:
1) The application of SPIKE, ABCDE, and SOCRATES assessment methods.
2) Patient history taking and bedside tests.
3) The importance of empathy, effective communication, and clinical decision-making.
